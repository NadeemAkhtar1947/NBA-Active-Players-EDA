Dataset for this project   collected from Kaggle. link of dataset is given below.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szymonjwiak/nba-active-players-data-images?select=players.csv

This dataset consist of two files:-
## a) players.csv 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szymonjwiak/nba-active-players-data-images?select=players.csv
## b) image
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szymonjwiak/nba-active-players-data-images?select=img

first, we need to create an image  dataframe i.e df, that contains two columns 'playerid' and 'Filename'. Filename basically keeps the image path.
After creating,   
we will merge both datasets on the basis of playerid. 
data = data.merge(df, left_on='playerid', right_on='playerid')
